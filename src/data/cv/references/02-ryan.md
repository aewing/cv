 "I've worked alongside Drew for almost a year and have seen him excel at moving the
product forward with his unique problem solving skills and passionate coding ability.
His knowledge of front-end javascript frameworks, web standards, ADA compliance, and
back-end technologies have helped us to increase our velocity and solve more problems in
less time. Drew's ideas and work will be beneficial for us long into the future, I
personally have learned a lot from him and have only optimistic predictions for his
career trajectory."
