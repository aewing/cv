"Drew is a very talented and brilliant software architect. He has the mind to craft
scalable, performant, and fault-tolerant applications. He has led a few of our software
initiatives since I have worked with him and has done a great job to execute on the
projects, from design to implementation, all the way through to completion. Drew knows
how to lead by example and inspires the teams he works on by paving the way on hard
tasks that can paralyze others. I would greatly recommend him to any company who needs a
productive and efficient leader."
